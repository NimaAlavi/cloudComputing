## Problem 2: Container Runtime

This problem involves implementing a simplified container runtime. This runtime will create isolated environments (containers) using Linux namespaces and a separate root filesystem.

### How to Run:

This section will be updated with detailed instructions on how to run the `cli.py` script once the implementation is complete.

### Features:

* Creates `net`, `mnt`, `pid`, and `uts` namespaces.
* Provides a separate root filesystem based on Ubuntu 20.04.
* (Bonus) Limits memory usage of the container.
